In the first part of this series, we covered setting up a Smithy codegen project such that the Smithy Gradle plugin calls into our codegen plugin when a model + settings are supplied into a codegen session. In the follow-up post, we'll implement a simple codegen that produces a GraphViz dot diagram that can then be used to generate an image if some aspects of a Smithy model. This work will demonstrate the basics of accessing model state from the Smithy APIs.
